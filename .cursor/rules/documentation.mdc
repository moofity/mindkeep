# Documentation Rules

## Documentation Maintenance

### Updating Documentation List

**CRITICAL**: Whenever a new documentation file is added to the `docs/` folder, you MUST update the "Documentation Structure" section in `docs/1-project-overview.md` to include the new file.

The documentation list should:

- Include all files in the `docs/` folder
- Use numeric prefixes for logical ordering (e.g., `1-project-overview.md`, `2-setup-guide.md`)
- Provide a brief description of each file's purpose
- Be kept in sync with actual files in the directory

Example format:

```markdown
## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized in multiple markdown files:

- `1-project-overview.md`: General project structure and purpose
- `2-setup-guide.md`: Development environment setup instructions
- `3-api-documentation.md`: API endpoints and usage
```

## File Naming Conventions

- Use numeric prefixes for ordering: `1-`, `2-`, `3-`, etc.
- Use kebab-case for file names: `setup-guide.md`, `api-documentation.md`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Match the file name to the main topic

## Content Guidelines

### Structure

- Start with a clear title (H1)
- Use descriptive section headers (H2, H3)
- Organize content logically with clear hierarchy
- Include a brief introduction/overview at the start

### Formatting

- Use proper markdown syntax
- Use code blocks with language tags for code examples
- Use lists for multiple items
- Use tables for structured data
- Keep line length reasonable (wrap at ~100 characters for readability)

### Code Examples

- Include language tags in code blocks: ` ```typescript`, ` ```bash`, etc.
- Provide context for code examples
- Show both examples and counter-examples when relevant
- Keep examples focused and relevant

### Links and References

- Use relative paths for internal documentation links
- Reference specific sections when linking: `[Setup Guide](./2-setup-guide.md#installation)`
- Keep external links to a minimum and make them clear

### Status Indicators

- Use checkmarks (✅) for completed items
- Use pending indicators (⏳) for planned/in-progress items
- Keep status sections up to date

## Writing Style

- Be clear and concise
- Use active voice when possible
- Write for developers who may be new to the project
- Include context and rationale, not just instructions
- Keep documentation current with code changes

## Markdown Best Practices

- Use `**bold**` for emphasis on important terms
- Use `*italic*` for subtle emphasis
- Use backticks for code, file names, and technical terms: `` `package.json` ``
- Use proper heading hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Use horizontal rules (`---`) sparingly, for major section breaks

## Documentation Updates

When updating documentation:

1. Check if the change affects other documentation files
2. Update cross-references if file names or sections change
3. Verify all code examples still work
4. Update the documentation list in `1-project-overview.md` if adding new files
5. Keep version numbers and dependency versions accurate
